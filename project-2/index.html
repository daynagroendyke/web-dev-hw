      <h3>Be confident!</h3>
      <p>
        Sometimes it can be hard to express ourselves in our own authenticity.
        <br />It's intimidating to know that people can see it, and even critique it. That's okay! 
        <br />Understand that your work is great, and there *will* be people who will enjoy your work.
