            <blockquote cite="https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nodoubt/justagirl.html">
      <p>Take this pink ribbon off my eyes
        <br />
          I'm exposed
        <br />
          And it's no big surprise
        <br />
          Don't you think I know
        <br />
          Exactly where I stand
        <br />
          This world is forcing me
        <br />
          To hold your hand
        <br />
          'Cause I'm just a girl, little ol' me
        <br />
          Well don't let me out of your sight
        <br />
          Oh, I'm just a girl, all pretty and petite
        <br />
          So don't let me have any rights
        <br />
          Oh, I've had it up to here!
        <br />
          The moment that I step outside
        <br />
          So many reasons
        <br />
          For me to run and hide
        <br />
          I can't do the little things
        <br />
          I hold so dear
        <br />
          'Cause it's all those little things
        <br />
          That I fear
        <br />
          'Cause I'm just a girl
        <br />
          I'd rather not be
        <br />
          'Cause they won't let me drive
        <br />
          Late at night
        <br />
          Oh I'm just a girl
        <br />
          Guess I'm some kind of freak
        <br >
          'Cause they all sit and stare
        <br />
          With their eyes
        <br />
          Oh I'm just a girl
        <br />
          Take a good look at me
        <br />
          Just your typical prototype
        <br />
          Oh, I've had it up to here!
        <br />
          Oh, am I making myself clear?
        <br />
          I'm just a girl
        <br />
          I'm just a girl in the world
        <br />
          That's all that you'll let me be!
        <br />
          Oh I'm just a girl, living in captivity
        <br />
          Your rule of thumb
        <br />
          Make me worry some
        <br />
          Oh I'm just a girl, what's my destiny?
        <br />
          What I've succumbed to
        <br />
          Is making me numb
        <br />
          Oh I'm just a girl, my apologies
        <br />
          What I've become is so burdensome
        <br />
          Oh I'm just a girl, lucky me
        <br />
          Twiddle-dum there's no comparison
        <br />
          Oh, I've had it up to!
        <br />
          Oh, I've had it up to!!
        <br />
          Oh, I've had it up to here
      </p>

  <h1>Why this topic?</h1>
  <p>What is this life if it is spent living someone elses dream?
    <br />
    One of the most important choices we can make in life,
    <br />
    is the decision to embrace our uniqueness and share our gifts with the world.
    <br />
    The first step in that process is to define who we would like to be, and
    <br />
    then fully immerse ourselves in that quest of character discovery.
    <br />
    So, that we can become teachers, and contributors.
