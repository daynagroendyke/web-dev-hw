  <h2>Lyrics to Puscifer - Bohemian Rhapsody (O.G. Mix)</h2>
    <p>Is this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?
<br>
Caught in a landslide
<br>
No escape from reality
<br>
Open your eyes
<br>
Look up to the skies and see
<br>
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
<br>
Because I'm easy come, easy go
<br>
Little high, little low
<br>
Anyway the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me
<br>
To me
<br>
Mama, just killed a man
<br>
Put a gun against his head
<br>
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
<br>
Mama, life had just begun
<br>
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
<br>
Mama, oooooooooo
<br>
Didn't mean to make you cry
<br>
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
<br>
Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters
<br>
Too late, my time has come
<br>
Sends shivers down my spine
<br>
Body's aching all the time
<br>
Goodbye everybody, I've got to go
<br>
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
<br>
Mama, ooooooooooh (Any way the wind blows)
<br>
I don't wanna die
<br>
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all
<br>
I see a little silhouetto of a man
<br>
Scaramouch, scaramouch will you do the Fandango
<br>
Thunderbolt and lightning - very very frightening me
<br>
Galileo, Galileo
<br>
Galileo, Galileo
<br>
Galileo figaro
<br>
Magnifico (oh, oh, oh, oh! )
<br>
I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
<br>
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
<br>
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
<br>
Easy come easy go, will you let me go
<br>
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go - let him go
<br>
Bismillah! We will not let you go - let him go
<br>
Bismillah! We will not let you go - let me go
<br>
Will not let you go - let me go - (Never, never, never, never, never let me go! )
<br>
Will not let you go - let me go, oh, oh, oh, oh -
<br>
No, no, no, no, no, no, no -
<br>
Oh, Mama Mia, Mama Mia, Mama Mia, let me go -
<br>
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me -
<br>
For me
<br>
For me!
<br>
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye
<br>
So you think you can love me and leave me to die
<br>
Oh Baby, can't do this to me baby
<br>
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right out of here
<br>
Ooo, ooo yeah
<br>
Ooo yeah
<br>
Nothing really matters,
<br>
Anyone can see,
<br>
Nothing really matters, nothing really matters to me,
<br>
Any way the wind blows...</p>
