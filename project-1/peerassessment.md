# Assessment of *If Tomorrow Never Comes* By Kazusa into

* **Site content:** This is a beautiful poem about the realization of the fragility
of life. Nice choice. :)
- The photo is really pretty.
- I like how the photo is actually on the page itself.
- I provided a link on my web page, and it changed the feel of things.

* **Code usage errors:** The code looks good to me. I do not see anything that
is off.

* **Overall Aesthetic** The only thing that I noticed that was interpreted
differently on my end was the links of the repo and live site. In my
submission I provided the repo link of the Project-1 directory. Which is
what was provided as the live link on this submission. For the live link
I provided the live link to the area of project-1 within the live site from
the web-dev-hw main directory. Other than that I think everything looks great
and was well thought out!
